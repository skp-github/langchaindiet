## 🌟 **Why LangchainDiet?**

While LangChain has been a popular choice for LLM-based applications, developers have identified several issues:

1. **Complexity and Overengineering**: LangChain's extensive features and complex abstractions lead to a steep learning curve.

2. **Performance Overhead**: Multiple layers of abstraction introduce computational overhead, making applications slower and less efficient.

3. **Inconsistent APIs**: Frequent API changes can cause code breakage, requiring constant updates.

4. **Poor Documentation**: Inadequate or outdated documentation hampers effective use of the framework.
